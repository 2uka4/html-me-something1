            <p id="intro"> Hi friend! I am so glad that I can tell you about where you can travel next. This is Mongolia
            where I have been born and raised. I know hectic our lives can be but I would love to suggest you place that
            you can make the unforgetable memories. In Mongolia you will find a canvas of rugged beauty capped by a sky
            so blue that pollution isnâ€™t even a word that exists here. Passing only wild horses, herds of cattle, an
            isolated ger in the distance and the odd truck also on its way to the city, life here is at its purest and
            beautiful.Down below I have written general idea about what you can do while staying Mongolia especially in
            Gorkhi-Terelj.
            GORKHI-TERELJ National Park is regarded as one of the most attractive and worthwhile destinations for those
            looking to relax in the vicinity of UB. If you enjoy adventurous activities like as trekking, rafting, horse
            or camel riding, and visiting nomad families and staying overnight in traditional Ger dwellings, in a short
            amount of time, this is the mesmerizing place to visit yet with super safe and welcomed and by friendly
            people.
            </p>
